description: "Update PR descriptions for a stacked PR tree with dependency visualization"

Update all PR descriptions in a stacked PR tree with dependency visualizations and concise summaries.

Base PR number: $ARGUMENTS

Use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations.

---

## Step 1: Discover PR tree

Fetch base PR:
```bash
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,state,body,url
```

BFS to find all child PRs. Maintain `Set<branchName>` of visited branches to avoid duplicates. For each unvisited branch:
```bash
gh pr list --base <branch-name> --state all --limit 100 --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,state,body,url
```

Build tree: `{ number, title, branch, baseBranch, state, body, url, children[] }`.

Keep traversing until no new children. Cap BFS at 20 levels.

No children found → update base PR summary if needed, report "No child PRs found for #$ARGUMENTS", stop.

---

## Step 2: Generate tree visualization

ASCII tree in markdown code block with "you are here" marker.

Status indicators:
- `✅` merged
- `⏳` open
- `❌` closed (not merged)

Format:
```
#993 ⏳ 360 UI changes (base)
 ├── #1000 ✅ kebab case file names
 ├── #1002 ✅ new 360 RMS addition
 └── #1027 ⏳ copy & UX polish 👈 you are here
      └── #1015 ⏳ analytics events
           └── #1029 ⏳ test coverage
```

Rules:
- `├──` for non-last children, `└──` for last child
- Indent: `(depth - 1) * 5 + 1` spaces per level
- `👈 you are here` only on PR being updated
- Base PR gets `(base) 👈 you are here` in its own description
- Truncate titles to ~50 chars

---

## Step 3: Detect empty vs existing descriptions

Strip standard template sections (`# Description`, `# Checklist`, `# Type of Change`, `# How Has This Been Tested`, etc.) and empty checkbox lists.

After stripping:
- < 20 chars remaining → **empty** (needs generated summary)
- Has `## Summary` section → **preserve it**, update tree/parent ref only
- Substantial content without `## Summary` → preserve as summary

---

## Step 4: Generate summary for empty PRs

```bash
gh pr diff <number> --name-only
```

```bash
gh pr diff <number> | head -200
```

Write 2-4 bullet summary. Example:
```markdown
## Summary
- Added kebab-case file renaming for all component files in `src/360/`
- Updated barrel exports and import paths across 12 files
- No functional changes — purely organizational
```

---

## Step 5: Update each PR description

### Base PR:
Add/replace `## PR Stack` at **top**, preserve rest:

```markdown
## PR Stack
\`\`\`
<tree visualization with 👈 you are here on this PR>
\`\`\`

---

<rest of existing body, preserved as-is>
```

### Child PRs:
Add/replace parent ref + `## PR Stack` at **top**, preserve rest:

```markdown
> **Parent PR:** [#<parent-number> — <parent-title>](<parent-url>)
> Targets `<base-branch-name>` — review against that base.

## PR Stack
\`\`\`
<tree visualization with 👈 you are here on this PR>
\`\`\`

---

## Summary
<preserved or generated summary bullets>

<rest of existing body content, preserved as-is>
```

If `## PR Stack` exists, replace only it (and parent ref block). Preserve everything else.

### Skip rules:
- Do NOT update closed/abandoned PRs (CLOSED and not MERGED)
- MERGED PRs: still update with tree (show as "updated" in report)
- Closed-not-merged: show in tree with ❌ but don't edit

### Applying updates:

```bash
# Ensure cleanup on error
trap 'rm -f /tmp/pr-body-*.md' EXIT

# Write body to temp file
cat > /tmp/pr-body-<number>.md << 'EOF_PR_BODY_d8f7a92b'
<full new body content>
EOF_PR_BODY_d8f7a92b

# Update the PR
gh pr edit <number> --body-file /tmp/pr-body-<number>.md

# Clean up
rm -f /tmp/pr-body-<number>.md
```

IMPORTANT: Use `--body-file` with temp file, NOT `--body` inline, to avoid shell escaping issues.

---

## Step 6: Report results

```
Updated N PRs:
  #993  (base)   — updated tree
  #1027 (child)  — updated tree + generated summary
  #1015 (child)  — updated tree, preserved existing summary
  #1000 (merged) — updated tree
  #999  (skip)   — closed, not updated
```

Include base PR URL for verification.

---

## Important notes

- Always fetch fresh PR data before updating
- Use `--limit 100` on all `gh pr list` calls
- State mapping: MERGED → ✅, OPEN → ⏳, CLOSED (not merged) → ❌
- Tree identical across all PRs except `👈 you are here` position
- Preserve images, links, formatting in existing descriptions
- Empty/invalid `$ARGUMENTS` → ask user for base PR number
